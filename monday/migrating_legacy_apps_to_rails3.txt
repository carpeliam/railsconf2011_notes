Migrating Legacy Rails Apps to Rails 3

bit.ly/rails3up
http://pinboard.in/u:crnixon/t:rails3upgrade/

Upgrade path from rails 2.3.x to rails3:
 * upgrade to latest rails 2.3.x
   rake rails:update
 * fix deprecation warnings
 * install rails_xss plugin and fix views.
 * rename .rhtml, .rxml, .rjs files
 * install Bundler
   gem install xxx
   rake rails:update:gems
 * replace plugins with gems
   put customized plugins into Gitbub and pull into Gemfile
 * install rails_upgrade plugin
    rake rails:upgrade:check # save output to a file
    rake rails:upgrade:backup # gives a list of backed-up files
    rake rails:upgrade:gems # doesn't check config/environments/*.rb for config.gem stuff
    rake rails:upgrade:routes # not perfect, but mostly works in rails3
    rake rails:upgrade:configuration # creates config/application.rb file
 * remove preinitializer.rb if you were using Bundler before
 * lib directory not autoloaded by default:
    config.load_path += %W(#{config.root}/lib)
 * ujs
    add csrf_meta_tag inside <head>
    install jquery-rails gem and install its rails.js to public/javascripts and include in app layout
    

XSS:
 * =h not used anymore;  =raw is opposite of =h
 * call :html_safe method on a String to 'make it safe'
 * YAML locale stirings are escaped unless the key name ends in '_html'
 * 
 
How to install bundler gems in production:
  bundle install --deployment

git tips:
 * git add --patch
 * git add --edit
Alternative to rvm and gemsets... install gems locally:
  bundle install --path vendor
  bundle package
  check your Gemfile.lock into version control
  

Dependencies, etc:
  * rspec:
    * New rspec syntax
      require 'rspec'
      require 'rspec/rails'
    * other rspec stuff
      make sure rspec-rails in in the development and test groups in Gemfile
      Cucumber uses the test environment now
    * might need to install rpec2-rails-views-matchers gem
  * factory_girl gem is renamed to factory_girl_rails gem for rails3
  * rails3 branch of will_paginate is in beta
    kaminari gem is stable and a good replacement for will_paginate
  * 

Ruby 1.9 stuff:
  * new syntax for case statements (breaks old stuff)
  * new optional syntax for Hash
