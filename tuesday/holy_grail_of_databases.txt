Holy Grail of Databases
=======================
Complexity is a symptom of confusion, not a cause

Terms:
  Database & datastore interchangeable
  
  SQL = !NoSQL
  NoSQL = linear scalability, distributability
  
  ACID
    Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable
  BASE
    Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency
  CAP Theorem
    consistent, available, persistent: pick 2
    
    Consistency:
      Strong = Atomic
      Weak = Eventual (eg, DNS)
    Availability
      The data is available when I want it.
    Partition Tolerance
      can tolerate nodes going down
    
    C&A- if you're marooned on a desert island, you won't know how many records beyonce has
    even with eventual consistency, you still won't know
    
  Common Patterns
    Replication
      copy data amongst nodes in a distributed db
      master/slave, etc
    NRW - nodes to write to per bucket, how many reads, /writes written to before success
      
    Consistent Hashing
      
    Map Reduce
      rooms = Room.all
      caps = rooms.map{|room| room.capacity }
      result = caps.reduce(0){|sum,capacity| sum+capacity}

Relational
  PostgreSQL - full-featured
  MySQL - lighter
  Drizzle - lightest
  CONSISTENT + AVAILABLE, but not persistence tolerant

  in MySQL, you can use engines like MEMORY where appropriate
  Postgres has all sorts of tools built-in like search, or sounds-like

Bigtable/Columnar style
  HBase
    thrift gem
    ORMs are not really necessary here.
  Cassandra
    cassandra gem

Document Datastore
  why? exact opposite usecase of relational schema.
    - don't make assumptions on how data is stored
    - queries do become more difficult
  Mongo
    built for scaling massively
    mongoid w/bson_ext (bson = binary json)
    geolocation is built-in (foursquare uses it)
  Couch
    built for durability
    heavier reliance on map/reduce
    ported to android? that's crazytalk. but true.

Key/Value Store
  Riak
    keys/values can be pretty much anything.. image, video, whatever

  Redis
    redis, hiredis (c driver)

  Chimera is a combination of redis and riak
  
NRW
  Quorum
  Weak
