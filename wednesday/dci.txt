inside: what the system is, the object (pretty much just data, and accessors)
outside: what the system does, the role

context maps objects to roles for specific situation

class MyContext
  def initialize(*args)
    my_obj = find_obj_from(args)
    my_obj.extend MyModule
  end
end

roles can be tested by mocking the inside
