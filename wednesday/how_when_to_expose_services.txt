37 signals has a lot of stuff that they manage.
Managing all that stuff is difficult:
  keeping all the plugins current
  supporting/testing multiple ruby/rails versions

redirect-to-service
  plugin as a service, served as its own website
  examples: google maps, braintree (credit card processing)
  drawbacks:
    if this service goes down, it *sucks*.
    hard to customize

web-service
  query the redirect-to-service service to see if it's up before redirecting there
  drawback: latency.

shared database
